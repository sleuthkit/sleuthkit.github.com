<p>The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is an open source library and set of tools for digital forensics. It allows you to analyze hard drives and other devices to find out who did what on them. </p>
<p>The bulk of TSK is located at <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org">www.sleuthkit.org</a> and the code is in a subversion repo. </p>
<p>We are trying github for some projects.  Currently, the 
<a href="http://sleuthkit.github.com/hadoop_framework/">Hadoop Forensics Framework</a> is located here. </p>
